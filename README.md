# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

This repository contains my solutions of problem sets and project for Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python course. The solutions demonstrate various concepts learned throughout the course, including:

- **Variables, Conditionals & Loops:** Fundamental programming constructs to control the flow of the program.
- **Functions:** Modular code design with reusable blocks of code.
- **Data Structures:** Implementation and manipulation of lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **APIs and Web Scraping:** Interaction with external data sources and web data extraction.
- **File I/O:** Reading from and writing to files using Python.
- **Testing:** Writing unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness using Pytest.
- **Regular Expressions:** Techniques for pattern matching and text manipulation using Python's re module.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Principles of classes and objects to create well-structured and maintainable code.
- **Final Project:** A comprehensive project integrating multiple concepts learned throughout the course.
